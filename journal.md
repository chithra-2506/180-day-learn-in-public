# 🌱 180 Days – Learn in Public 🚀

💭 Where It All Begins:

If you’re reading this, know this isn’t just a public coding log — it’s a piece of me.

I used to be a very good student — not just academically, but in everything I did. A happy little girl with big dreams, full of energy, discipline, and drive. 

But when things didn’t go as I had imagined during my JEE journey, it broke something inside me.
I was left in a state of mind I had never experienced before — confused, shaken, and honestly, just lost. That one phase changed so much in me. I kind of gave up on myself for a while.

From that point on, I stopped trying like I used to. I ended up in a college I never really connected with, surrounded by an environment that didn’t match the energy or ambition I once had. I was far from the version of myself that felt alive, confident, and hopeful.

But somewhere deep down, even when everything felt off, I knew I still had it in me.
I just needed a reason, a restart. And this is it.

This is more than a coding challenge — this is my comeback story.
It’s a promise I’m making to myself: to try again, to believe again, and to rebuild — not just my skills, but me.

## 🌟 Why This Journey?

In a world that’s evolving with tech every single day, I don’t just want to keep up —
I want to **create, grow, learn, and rise**.

This journey is personal. Public. Purposeful.
This is **180 days of rebuilding, unlearning, relearning, and becoming**.

I’m not starting from scratch. I’m starting from experience.

## ✨ Note to Anyone Reading

If you’ve ever felt like you lost your spark…  
If you’ve ever seen others fly while you stayed grounded…  
If you’ve ever cried alone in silence, thinking your best days are over…  

This journal is for **you** too.

Come back with me.

## 🛠 DAILY LOGS

---

### **📅 DAY 1 – May 2, 2025**  
**Theme:** *The Rebirth – Starting Again on My Birthday*

What I did:

- 🎂 Celebrated my birthday, not as a girl who’s broken, but as a girl who’s *breaking free*  
- 🧠 Spent intentional time reflecting on where I went wrong, what broke me, and who I want to become  
- 📘 Wrote down my learnings from the past 2 years: the rise, the fall, and now, the rise again  
- 🗂 Committed to this 180-day challenge — as a *gift to my future self*

**Reflection:**  

Today was the *most important step*: deciding to show up again.  
Not for the world. For *me*.

---

### **📅 DAY 2 to DAY 8 - MAY 3 to 9, 2025 (📍1 Week of Planning & Preparation)**

Before diving deep into my 180 Days of Tech Journey, I dedicated a full week to set up everything with clarity, focus, and long-term vision.

---

- Created a private GitHub repo for drafts, notes, and version tracking.

🧰 **Environment Ready:** No distractions later—I can now focus purely on learning and building.

---

  Day 5: Designed My Learning System
- Built a 180-day calendar with flexible learning blocks.
- Planned “Focus Weeks” for each major topic.
- Added weekly review & rest days to avoid burnout.

📌 **Strategy:** 5 hours daily commitment, tracked and optimized.

---

  Day 6: Built My Support Circle
- Joined  Discord, twitter and LinkedIn.
- Followed mentors and devs on Twitter for daily inspiration.
- Subscribed to newsletters like Codeforces, Dev.to, and Hacker News.

🌐 **Goal:** Stay connected to what’s happening, get help fast, and never feel alone in the process.

---

  Day 7: Review & Recalibrate
- Reviewed the entire plan critically.
- Adjusted learning pace to match personal energy & college timing.
- Updated the phase timelines to include buffer space.

🔁 **Result:** My plan feels real, doable, and tailored to my lifestyle.

---

  Day 8: Commit to Learning in Public
- Finalized my GitHub Learn-In-Open structure.
- Drafted README.md with goals, journey, and roadmap.
- Decided to keep it private until I finish 180 days—then go public with everything.
- Added folders for:  
  - `Day-wise logs`  
  - `Certificates & Gigs`  
  - `Projects by Phase`  
  - `Final Resume & Portfolio assets`  

🌱 **Commitment:** I’m ready to start building from tomorrow. Every day counts from here!

### **📅 Day 9 to Day 11 - May 10 to 12, 2025 (C Programming Recap & Completion 🌟)**

✅ I revisited **C Programming**, which I had previously studied in my first semester.  
🧠 I focused on reinforcing my basics and solving problems that I had left halfway on HackerRank.  
💪 Over these 3 days, I:

- Revamped my logic with conditional statements, loops, and functions in C
- Completed the pending problems and challenges
- Achieved a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **5-Star Badge in C Programming on HackerRank**

### **📆 Day 12 to Day 14 - May 13 to 15, 2025 (Python Basics Revisited & HackerRank Progress 💡)**

After revising the basics of Python that I had learned in my first semester — including variables, data types, functions, file handling, and control structures — I started solving Python problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/your_username_here). 🧠

🛠️ Current Focus:
- Strengthening foundational Python skills.
- Consistently solving HackerRank problems (target: complete all Python sections by month-end).
- Practicing clean, readable code and learning through repetition.

---

### **📆 Day 15 to Day 17 - May 16 to 18, 2025 (Introduction to DSA in C & Python 🔁📚)**

As DSA is part of my current semester (1-2), I began understanding the theoretical concepts first — what each data structure is and why we use them (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues). 

I am learning to implement these both in **C** (for exams) and **Python** (for real-world and projects). For now, it's been about:
- 💭 Understanding *what DSA is really about*.
- 📌 Preparing for deeper dives into each concept, both practically and academically.
- 🧾 Planning to master C/Python DSA implementations before the July semester exams.

---

### **📆 Day 18 - May 19, 2025 (Special Day Project – Parents' Anniversary Surprise 🎂🎉)**

Today was very special — it was my **parents' anniversary**, and I decided to surprise them with a fun project made using **Python** and the help of **ChatGPT**. Since I’m still learning HTML/CSS/JS, I relied on guidance to bring it to life.

✨ **What the Project Does**:
- Displays a beautiful "**Happy Anniversary Mom & Dad**" message.
- Shows an animated **cake**, **balloons**, and **hearts** on screen.
- Runs locally on browser via a Python script using Flask.

> I faced a *lot* of challenges:
- Setting up **VS Code** for web and Python development.
- Installing and reinstalling necessary extensions and environments.
- Dealing with bugs, terminal issues, and confusion — but I didn’t give up.

After this project, I realized something important:

> “Just learning concepts is not enough. I need to go **in-depth** and start building meaningful things **on my own**.”

So, I started searching for the best Python development path — and I came across the **[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)** on Udemy which is under my budget and also led by a wonderful instructor.

### **📆 Day 19 – Day 30 - MAy 20 to 31, 2025 (Life Got in the Way – Shifting, College & Chaos)**

These past 12 days weren’t very productive in terms of technical skill-building. Here's why:

- 🏠 We’ve been busy with our **house shifting process**, which took a lot of time and energy.
- 👩‍👧 I was **helping my mom** and managing household responsibilities.
- 📝 Meanwhile, my college work **piled up** — with endless **assignments**, **online classes**, and **exam prep** for the upcoming semester.
- 📚 Summer holidays didn’t feel like a break — they were filled with academic catch-up and responsibilities.

Although I couldn’t focus on coding or personal projects during this phase, I’m documenting this honestly to show that not every day is productive — and that’s okay.

🔜 Back to tech grind from Day 31 with more fire!
