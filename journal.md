# 🌱 180 Days – Learn in Public 🚀

💭 Where It All Begins:

If you’re reading this, know this isn’t just a public coding log — it’s a piece of me.

I used to be a very good student — not just academically, but in everything I did. A happy little girl with big dreams, full of energy, discipline, and drive. 

But when things didn’t go as I had imagined during my JEE journey, it broke something inside me.
I was left in a state of mind I had never experienced before — confused, shaken, and honestly, just lost. That one phase changed so much in me. I kind of gave up on myself for a while.

From that point on, I stopped trying like I used to. I ended up in a college I never really connected with, surrounded by an environment that didn’t match the energy or ambition I once had. I was far from the version of myself that felt alive, confident, and hopeful.

But somewhere deep down, even when everything felt off, I knew I still had it in me.
I just needed a reason, a restart. And this is it.

This is more than a coding challenge — this is my comeback story.
It’s a promise I’m making to myself: to try again, to believe again, and to rebuild — not just my skills, but me.

## 🌟 Why This Journey?

In a world that’s evolving with tech every single day, I don’t just want to keep up —
I want to **create, grow, learn, and rise**.

This journey is personal. Public. Purposeful.
This is **180 days of rebuilding, unlearning, relearning, and becoming**.

I’m not starting from scratch. I’m starting from experience.

## ✨ Note to Anyone Reading

If you’ve ever felt like you lost your spark…  
If you’ve ever seen others fly while you stayed grounded…  
If you’ve ever cried alone in silence, thinking your best days are over…  

This journal is for **you** too.

Come back with me.

## 🎯 END GOALS

By the end of these 180 days, I aim to:

- ✅ Master core programming and creative tech skills  
- ✅ Build meaningful, real-world projects  
- ✅ Reflect, write, and build a visible, honest portfolio

- ✅ Create something that speaks louder than my past

This is my *base*. My *foundation*. My *rebirth*.

## 🛠 DAILY LOGS

---

### **DAY 1 – May 2, 2025**  
**Theme:** *The Rebirth – Starting Again on My Birthday*

What I did:

- 🎂 Celebrated my birthday, not as a girl who’s broken, but as a girl who’s *breaking free*  
- 🧠 Spent intentional time reflecting on where I went wrong, what broke me, and who I want to become  
- 📘 Wrote down my learnings from the past 2 years: the rise, the fall, and now, the rise again  
- 🗂 Committed to this 180-day challenge — as a *gift to my future self*

**Reflection:**  

Today was the *most important step*: deciding to show up again.  
Not for the world. For *me*.

---

### **DAY 2 – May 3, 2025**  
**Theme:** *Know Before You Go – Researching the Terrain*

What I did:

- 🔍 Explored the tech landscape — roles, paths, people  
- 🌐 Understood what excites me, what feels right
- 🧭 Researched what it takes to build a strong profile in tech
- 📌 Jotted down the key elements: languages, DSA, open source, personal branding, internships, consistency  
- 🧵 Learned about how “learning in public” builds visibility and confidence

**Reflection:**  
I’ve realized — I don’t need to know everything right now. I just need to **start with clarity**.  
This journey isn’t about proving I’m the best — it’s about becoming *better every single day*.

---

### **DAY 3 - May 4, 2025**  
**Theme:** Plan Like a Pro  
**What I did:**  
📅 I created my own action plan — customized to my pace, goals, and style.  
🎯 It’s not copied from anyone. It’s personal, flexible, and purpose-driven.  
🔜 You’ll start seeing how that plan unfolds in the coming days.  

**Reflection:**  
It feels good to take control of your own journey.  
The best plan is not always the one fully mapped out from the start — it’s the one that grows with you. That’s the kind of plan I’m building. Step by step, I'm figuring things out, staying open to new opportunities and skills as they arise — not by changing directions randomly, but by evolving with intention.
