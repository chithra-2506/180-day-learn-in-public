# ðŸŒ± 180 Days â€“ Learn in Public ðŸš€

ðŸ’­ Where It All Begins:

If youâ€™re reading this, know this isnâ€™t just a public coding log â€” itâ€™s a piece of me.

I used to be a very good student â€” not just academically, but in everything I did. A happy little girl with big dreams, full of energy, discipline, and drive. 

But when things didnâ€™t go as I had imagined during my JEE journey, it broke something inside me.
I was left in a state of mind I had never experienced before â€” confused, shaken, and honestly, just lost. That one phase changed so much in me. I kind of gave up on myself for a while.

From that point on, I stopped trying like I used to. I ended up in a college I never really connected with, surrounded by an environment that didnâ€™t match the energy or ambition I once had. I was far from the version of myself that felt alive, confident, and hopeful.

But somewhere deep down, even when everything felt off, I knew I still had it in me.
I just needed a reason, a restart. And this is it.

This is more than a coding challenge â€” this is my comeback story.
Itâ€™s a promise Iâ€™m making to myself: to try again, to believe again, and to rebuild â€” not just my skills, but me.

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Journey?

In a world thatâ€™s evolving with tech every single day, I donâ€™t just want to keep up â€”
I want to **create, grow, learn, and rise**.

This journey is personal. Public. Purposeful.
This is **180 days of rebuilding, unlearning, relearning, and becoming**.

Iâ€™m not starting from scratch. Iâ€™m starting from experience.

## âœ¨ Note to Anyone Reading

If youâ€™ve ever felt like you lost your sparkâ€¦  
If youâ€™ve ever seen others fly while you stayed groundedâ€¦  
If youâ€™ve ever cried alone in silence, thinking your best days are overâ€¦  

This journal is for **you** too.

Come back with me.

## ðŸŽ¯ END GOALS

By the end of these 180 days, I aim to:

- âœ… Master core programming and creative tech skills  
- âœ… Build meaningful, real-world projects  
- âœ… Reflect, write, and build a visible, honest portfolio  
- âœ… Explore open source, internships, and competitions  
- âœ… Create something that speaks louder than my past

This is my *base*. My *foundation*. My *rebirth*.
