# 🌱180 DAYS – LEARN IN PUBLIC

Welcome to my 180-day journey of skill-building, creativity, and consistency.  
This isn't just about learning to code — it's about growing into the kind of person who builds meaningful things, solves real-world problems, and stands out in a crowd of talent.

## 🌟 WHY THIS JOURNEY?

In a world moving fast with tech, I don’t want to just keep up — I want to **lead, create, and innovate**.  
This is my 180-day commitment to becoming someone whose work speaks louder than their words.  
Through this journey, I’m choosing **action, growth, and visibility** over perfection.

## 🎯 END GOALS

By the end of these 180 days, I aim to:

- ✅ Master core skills in programming and creative tech  
- ✅ Build real-world projects  
- ✅ Contribute publicly, reflect daily, and build a visible portfolio  
- ✅ Explore internships, competitions, and open source  
- ✅ Create something I’m truly proud of

This journey is my **launchpad**.

## 🛠 DAILY LOGS

### **DAY 1 – May 2, 2025**  
**Theme:** Laying the foundation on my birthday!!!

**What I did:**

- 🧠 Spent time reflecting on what I want to achieve  
- 📘 Understood where I stand and where I want to go  
- 🌱 Clarified my goals and vision for the next 180 days  
- 🗂 Planned the structure of this journey and set up this repo  

**Reflection:**  
Instead of rushing into tutorials or coding right away, I took a moment to understand *why* I’m doing this.  
Today was all about **intention setting** — not just for skills, but for who I want to become.  
This is my **starting line**.
