# 🌱 180 Days – Learn in Public 🚀

💭 Where It All Begins:

If you’re reading this, know this isn’t just a public coding log — it’s a piece of me.

I used to be a very good student — not just academically, but in everything I did. A happy little girl with big dreams, full of energy, discipline, and drive. 

But when things didn’t go as I had imagined during my JEE journey, it broke something inside me.
I was left in a state of mind I had never experienced before — confused, shaken, and honestly, just lost. That one phase changed so much in me. I kind of gave up on myself for a while.

From that point on, I stopped trying like I used to. I ended up in a college I never really connected with, surrounded by an environment that didn’t match the energy or ambition I once had. I was far from the version of myself that felt alive, confident, and hopeful.

But somewhere deep down, even when everything felt off, I knew I still had it in me.
I just needed a reason, a restart. And this is it.

This is more than a coding challenge — this is my comeback story.
It’s a promise I’m making to myself: to try again, to believe again, and to rebuild — not just my skills, but me.

## 🌟 Why This Journey?

In a world that’s evolving with tech every single day, I don’t just want to keep up —
I want to **create, grow, learn, and rise**.

This journey is personal. Public. Purposeful.
This is **180 days of rebuilding, unlearning, relearning, and becoming**.

I’m not starting from scratch. I’m starting from experience.

## ✨ Note to Anyone Reading

If you’ve ever felt like you lost your spark…  
If you’ve ever seen others fly while you stayed grounded…  
If you’ve ever cried alone in silence, thinking your best days are over…  

This journal is for **you** too.

Come back with me.

## 🎯 END GOALS

By the end of these 180 days, I aim to:

- ✅ Master core programming and creative tech skills  
- ✅ Build meaningful, real-world projects  
- ✅ Reflect, write, and build a visible, honest portfolio  
- ✅ Explore open source, internships, and competitions  
- ✅ Create something that speaks louder than my past

This is my *base*. My *foundation*. My *rebirth*.

## 🛠 DAILY LOGS

### **DAY 1 – May 2, 2025**  
**Theme:** *The Rebirth – Starting Again on My Birthday*

What I did:

- 🎂 Celebrated my birthday, not as a girl who’s broken, but as a girl who’s *breaking free*  
- 🧠 Spent intentional time reflecting on where I went wrong, what broke me, and who I want to become  
- 📘 Wrote down my learnings from the past 2 years: the rise, the fall, and now, the rise again  
- 🗂 Committed to this 180-day challenge — as a *gift to my future self*

**Reflection:**  

Today was the *most important step*: deciding to show up again.  
Not for the world. For *me*.

### **DAY 2 TO DAY 8 - MAY 3 TO 9, 2025 (📍1 Week of Planning & Preparation)

Before diving deep into my 180 Days of Tech Journey, I dedicated a full week to set up everything with clarity, focus, and long-term vision.

---

#### ✅ Day 2: Define My Vision & Mission
- Took time to reflect deeply on *why* I’m starting this journey.
- Wrote a personal mission statement to guide my decisions.

📝 **Outcome:** I now have a clear reason and purpose behind each skill I’ll learn.

---

#### 🔍 Day 3: Explore the Tech Landscape
- Researched top tech roles (developer, data analyst, game dev, etc.).
- Studied skills required for each domain using job boards and mentor blogs.
- Understood what recruiters and universities look for in portfolios.

📚 **Insight:** The demand is high—but so is the opportunity to stand out by building real, meaningful projects.

---

#### ⚙️ Day 4: Set Up My Tech Toolkit
- Installed Python, VS Code, Git, GitHub CLI.
- Set up a folder structure for each phase (Python, DSA, Web Dev, etc.).
- Created a private GitHub repo for drafts, notes, and version tracking.

🧰 **Environment Ready:** No distractions later—I can now focus purely on learning and building.

---

#### 📅 Day 5: Designed My Learning System
- Built a 180-day calendar with flexible learning blocks.
- Planned “Focus Weeks” for each major topic.
- Added weekly review & rest days to avoid burnout.

📌 **Strategy:** 5 hours daily commitment, tracked and optimized.

---

#### 🤝 Day 6: Built My Support Circle
- Joined communities on Discord, GitHub, and LinkedIn (GirlScript, Hack Club, etc.).
- Followed mentors and devs on Twitter for daily inspiration.
- Subscribed to newsletters like Codeforces, Dev.to, and Hacker News.

🌐 **Goal:** Stay connected to what’s happening, get help fast, and never feel alone in the process.
