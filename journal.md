180 Days - Learn in Public 🚀
Welcome to my 180-day journey of skill-building, creativity, and consistency. This isn't just about learning to code — it's about growing into the kind of person who builds meaningful things, solves real-world problems, and stands out in a crowd of talent.

🌟 Why This Journey?
In a world moving fast with tech, I don’t want to just keep up — I want to lead, create, and innovate. This is my 180-day commitment to becoming someone whose work speaks louder than their words. Through this journey, I’m choosing action, growth, and visibility over perfection.

🎯END GOALS
By the end of these 180 days, I aim to:
✅ Master core skills in programming, and creative tech
✅ Build real-world projects 
✅ Contribute publicly, reflect daily, and build a visible portfolio
✅ Explore internships, competitions, and open-source
✅ Create something I'm truly proud of...
this journey is my launchpad.

Reflection:
Instead of rushing into tutorials or coding right away, I took a moment to understand why I’m doing this. Today was all about intention setting — not just for skills, but for who I want to become. This is my starting line.
